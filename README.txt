This is the very first project I created. The most important thing for me
is the opinion of experienced developers. Please let me know about
beginner errors I made so I can work on them later.
The idea was to create single web page application I imagined.
App is called Car Service E-book and it's made for keeping records about
services of your car.

I started to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL about 6 months ago.
I thougt it would be better to learn through creating something, not only
theory. So I came up with the idea on creating this Car Service E-book.
When I started it I only knew the basics of HTML and very little about
CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.

If someone find useful this app feel free to use it.
Also if someone think that it could be advanced please send
your suggestions.
All critics and suggestions are welcome...

COMPATIBILITY
The app is developed for big screens, not for phones and tablets (there is not a bit of RWD :-D).
